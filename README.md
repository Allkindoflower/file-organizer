File Organizer Script
This script helps organize files in your Downloads folder by moving them into categorized folders on your Desktop based on file extensions.

How to use
Update the downloads_folder_location variable with the path to your Downloads folder.

Run the script.

Files will be moved into folders like "PDFs," "Images," "Applications," etc., created on your Desktop.

If a folder doesnâ€™t exist, the script will create it automatically.

Notes
The script skips folders and files without an extension.

Make sure to back up important files before running it, just in case.

You can add or modify file extensions and their target folders in the extensions dictionary.
